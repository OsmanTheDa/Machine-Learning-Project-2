</h1>  Music Recommendation System Project   </h1>
In this music recommendation system project, we aim to create a personalized music recommendation engine using machine learning techniques. Let’s break down the steps involved:
1.	Import Libraries:
o	We start by importing essential Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. These libraries will help us handle data, perform analysis, and build our recommendation model.
2.	Load the Data:
o	We work with two datasets: 
	Triplets File: Contains information about user-song interactions (e.g., which songs users listened to).
	Song Data: Includes details about the songs (e.g., artist, genre, acoustic features).
o	We load these datasets into data frames for further processing.
3.	Data Cleaning:
o	We clean the data by: 
	Removing rows with missing values (e.g., null genre information).
	Dropping unnecessary columns that won’t be used in our recommender system.
4.	Data Consolidation:
o	We combine the triplets and song data frames using a common column (Song ID).
o	Duplicate Song IDs are removed to prevent inflated results after joining.
5.	Model Preparation:
o	To improve performance, we select only 50,000 records from the consolidated data frame.
o	We create a new feature by combining the song title and artist name.
o	We calculate the cumulative sum of listen counts for each song.
6.	Popularity Recommendation Engine:
o	We import a popularity-based recommender model.
o	For User 5 and User 100, we display the top 10 popular songs.
o	Note that popularity ratings are the same for all users.
7.	Item Similarity Recommendation:
o	We import an item similarity model.
o	We analyze song history for User 5 and User 100.
o	Based on their history, we recommend songs using item similarity.
8.	Recommendation Based on Song Name:
o	Given a selected song, we provide personalized recommendations.
o	We can repeat this process for any other song
