</h1> Music Recommendation System Project </h1>
Welcome to our Music Recommendation System project! In this repository, we‚Äôve built a personalized music recommendation engine using machine learning techniques. Whether you‚Äôre a music enthusiast or a data science aficionado, this project has something for you.
</h1>Overview</h1>
Our recommendation system aims to provide users with song suggestions based on their preferences and listening history. We‚Äôve broken down the project into several key steps
</h1>Usage</h1>
Feel free to explore the code, dive into the data, and experiment with different recommendation techniques. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, a curious learner, or just someone who loves discovering new music, this project has something for everyone.
</h1>Installation</h1>
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up your Python environment (we recommend using a virtual environment).
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the project step by step.
</h1>Contribution</h1>
We welcome contributions! If you have ideas for improving the recommendation system, enhancing the data cleaning process, or adding new features, feel free to submit a pull request.

</h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
We‚Äôd like to thank the open-source community, the artists, and the music lovers who inspire us to create better recommendation systems.
